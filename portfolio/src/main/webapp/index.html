      <h1>Brandon Vu's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am a first year at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science.
        In my free time I like to hike, drink water and play with this japanese toy called the kendama.<p/>
        <img src="images/kendama.jpg" id = "kendamaImage" >
      <p> 
        Working from home is a new 
        experience, but the day I got access to Memegen, I have never been the same.
        Looking forward to learning a lot this summer!<p/>
